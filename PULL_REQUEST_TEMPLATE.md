# OrthoFi Pull Request Form  
*Pull requests to the risk branch require approval.*  
*This approval is to cover both compliance and code review.*

<!-- When opening a pull request to main this form will be overwritten and replaced with a different template.
The form will be updated by a GitHub Action, after which you can fill it out. -->

---
*The risk branch is a protected branch that can only be modified via a pull request with at least one approval.*  
*In non-standard repos without a risk branch, required pull request approval will be added automatically for pull requests to main.*

<!-- Non-standard repos are currently client-monorepo and the terraform tf-* repos>
